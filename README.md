# Design of Intelligent Touch Switch

The design of intelligent touch switch was the project my team did in the Shanghai University. My work in the team was to write the software part. And my team members were to do the hardware part and the bluetooth part.
The project was to design an intelligent touch switch of a bath bully with various functions, such as the traditional function of air heating system, night igniting system and the warning for falling down in the bathroom.

Functions of the code:

1) the Control of Switches (Power, Warm winding, Lighting, Blowing, Ventilate)
The judgements of whether the buttons are pressed according to the change of the voltages changes. 

2) the Control of Temperature:
The digital tube can display real-time temperature and when the real temperature is lower than the set temperature and people have pressed the button of warm-winding, warm winding will go to walk.

3) the Control of Light:
The light will work only when people press the button in the dim light and the switch finds someone passing by in the evening (darker than the dim light).

4) Safety Warning:
If people press one button for a long time, the switch will be in a warning state.

5) the Connect with Phone
People can watch the situation of the switch with their phone and send the commands to the switch.
